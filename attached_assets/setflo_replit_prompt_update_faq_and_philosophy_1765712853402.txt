REPLIT PROMPT — UPDATE FAQ COPY + ADD SETFLO PHILOSOPHY BLOCK

GOAL:
Update the website’s FAQ copy to better reflect Setflo’s core philosophy (one focus, no guilt, no nagging),
and add a one-paragraph “Setflo Philosophy” block in an appropriate place on the site.

--------------------------------------------------
1) UPDATE THESE FAQ ENTRIES (REPLACE EXISTING COPY)
--------------------------------------------------

FAQ: “Is it a habit tracker?”
Replace the current answer with:

“No. Setflo is a focus tracker. It measures time spent practicing one skill so you can see your effort add up — even if it happens in small sessions. It’s about progress you can feel and prove, not managing a list of habits.”

---

FAQ: “Why doesn’t Setflo have reminders / schedules / notifications?”
Replace the current answer with:

“Setflo is designed to support practice when you choose to show up — not to guilt you into it. It doesn’t try to run your day or create pressure. When you practice, you log the time. That’s it. Calm, minimal, and intentional.”

NOTE:
If the site currently mentions notifications more broadly, keep it consistent with the app:
You may clarify that notifications are minimal and optional (for example, daily targets),
but avoid language that suggests nagging reminders.

---

FAQ: “Do I have to create an account?”
Replace the current answer with:

“No. Setflo doesn’t require an account because your practice shouldn’t depend on logins, sign-ups, or syncing. It’s built to be simple and private: open the app, practice, log time, move on. Your data stays on your device unless you choose to export it.”

--------------------------------------------------
2) ADD A “THE SETFLO PHILOSOPHY” CONTENT BLOCK
--------------------------------------------------

Add a new section titled:

“The Setflo Philosophy”

Placement:
Ideally near the top of the page after the hero section, or just before the FAQ section.

Use this exact paragraph copy:

“Setflo is built on a simple belief: meaningful progress comes from showing up, not being pushed. It doesn’t try to manage your habits, optimise your schedule, or keep you accountable with guilt. Instead, Setflo gives you a clear, honest record of time spent practicing one thing — so you can see that effort accumulate in its own way. No noise. No pressure. Just a quiet tool that respects your focus, your autonomy, and the long view of mastery.”

--------------------------------------------------
3) TONE & IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------------------------------------

• Keep tone slightly rebellious but calm and minimal  
• Maintain existing typography and layout style  
• Do NOT add new features or promises (no AI, no social, no habit stacks)  
• Ensure copy aligns with the guiding principle: “One focus. No distractions.”
