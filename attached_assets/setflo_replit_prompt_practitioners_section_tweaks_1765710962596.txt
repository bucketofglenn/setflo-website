REPLIT WEBSITE UPDATE PROMPT — Setflo (setflo.io)

Goal: Make small copy + UI tweaks to the “Built for practitioners” section (the grid of cards).

Context
- This section contains cards like: Music practice, Martial arts, Writing, Rehab & recovery, Language learning.
- Setflo is a minimalist “one focus, no distractions” practice timer / tracker.
- Key nuance: Setflo tracks TOTAL TIME spent practicing (one timer + streak/targets). It does NOT track sub-items inside a session (e.g., “scales / études / repertoire” separately).
- The value prop: any practice counts — serious work and casual play both add up.

What to change

1) Update the “Music practice” card copy
- Current copy implies users can track sub-items individually.
- Replace it with copy that clearly communicates:
  - it tracks total time spent on the instrument
  - any practice counts (serious pieces, warmups, improvising, “Lost in the Woods”, etc.)
- Keep it short, friendly, and consistent with the site’s tone.

Suggested replacement copy (feel free to tweak slightly):
Title: Music practice
Body: “Piano, guitar, drums—any instrument. Track total time at the instrument. Warmups, repertoire, and just playing around all count.”

2) Add a new card for “Any skill” (so users don’t feel limited)
- Add an additional card to the same grid that communicates: “anything you want to track”.
- Keep the same visual style: icon + title + 1–2 sentences.
- Copy should reinforce flexibility + simplicity.

Suggested new card:
Title: Any skill
Body: “Coding, drawing, chess, breathwork—whatever you’re practicing. Set one focus and let the minutes add up.”

Implementation notes
- Preserve the existing layout, spacing, typography, and any hover/animation behavior.
- Use an icon that matches the current icon style (simple line icon).
  - If using lucide-react or similar, options like Sparkles / Target / Zap are fine.
- Keep the grid responsive:
  - Desktop: tidy rows.
  - Mobile: clean single-column stack.
- Do not introduce new features or claims beyond time tracking / consistency.

Deliverable
- Apply changes in the page/component where this section is defined.
- If the cards are driven by a data array (recommended), update the array:
  - modify the Music practice description
  - add the new Any skill card object
