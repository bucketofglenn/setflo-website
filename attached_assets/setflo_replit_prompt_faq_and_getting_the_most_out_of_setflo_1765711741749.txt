REPLIT PROMPT — Update “Questions” section into two sections:
1) FAQ
2) Getting the most out of Setflo

Goal
- Split the current “Questions” accordion into TWO separate accordion groups/sections.
- Keep the existing clean, minimalist styling and spacing consistent with the rest of the site.
- Maintain accessibility (keyboard navigation, aria attributes), and preserve responsive layout.

Where
- Locate the section currently titled “Questions” (likely a component/section like <Questions /> / <FAQ />).
- Replace it with:
  A) Section: “FAQ”
  B) Section: “Getting the most out of Setflo”

Structure (recommended)
- Use two stacked sections, each with:
  - Large H2 title centered (same typographic scale as existing “Questions” header)
  - Accordion list beneath
- Keep the same accordion item design (question row + chevron + divider line)
- Default state: collapsed, click to expand.

Section A: FAQ (Accordion Items)
1) Q: Is it a habit tracker?
   A: Not exactly. Setflo is a focus tracker — it measures time spent practicing one skill so you can see your progress add up.

2) Q: Do I need streaks?
   A: No. Streaks are optional. Set a daily target if it helps, but Setflo is built to keep you practicing — not to guilt you.

3) Q: Is my data private?
   A: Yes. Your practice data stays on your device unless you choose to export it.

4) Q: Can I rename my focus later?
   A: Yes.
      You can update the name of your focus at any time without affecting your saved practice data.
      If you want to commit to a completely new goal, we recommend starting fresh by clearing your existing data and beginning again.
      This reflects the core philosophy of Setflo: one goal at a time.

Section B: Getting the most out of Setflo (Accordion Items)
1) Q: Choose one focus — and keep it simple
   A: Pick a single skill you want to improve. A clear focus makes progress feel obvious.

2) Q: Count everything that moves you forward
   A: Warmups, drills, messy sessions, deep work — it all counts. Setflo helps you see that it adds up.

3) Q: Use a daily target as a “minimum”
   A: Set a small daily target you can hit even on busy days. It’s about consistency, not perfection.

4) Q: Review your history, not your mood
   A: On off days, check your calendar and totals. Your progress is larger than any single session.

5) Q: Start fresh when the goal changes
   A: If your focus genuinely changes, clearing data can be a powerful reset. One focus, one chapter at a time.

Copy/Design Notes
- Keep tone calm, concise, and non-technical.
- Avoid heavy marketing language.
- Keep answers short (2–4 lines) and scannable.

Implementation Details
- If the current section is a single array of questions, split into two arrays: faqItems and tipsItems.
- Render two accordions with shared AccordionItem component to avoid duplication.
- Keep the section IDs stable for navigation (e.g., #faq and #getting-the-most-out-of-setflo) if there’s a header nav; otherwise optional.
- Ensure consistent margins between sections (e.g., 48–72px vertical gap).

Definition of Done
- Page shows two headings: “FAQ” and “Getting the most out of Setflo”
- Each has its own accordion list
- Styling matches existing site
- Mobile looks clean with correct spacing
- No lint/build errors
