REPLIT PROMPT — BUILD THE FULL SETFLO WEBSITE (setflo.io)

Domain + socials (use these placeholders throughout the site — I’ll set them up later):
- Primary domain: https://setflo.io
- Instagram: https://instagram.com/setflo.io
Recommended email addresses (use these in mailto links + copy):
- Support: support@setflo.io  (primary user support)
- Privacy: privacy@setflo.io  (privacy requests)
- Press: press@setflo.io      (press/partnerships)
- Hello: hello@setflo.io      (general contact)
- Legal: legal@setflo.io      (terms/legal requests)

IMPORTANT: The site should be deploy-ready even if these inboxes don’t exist yet.

================================================================================
GOAL
Create a clean, fast, slightly rebellious marketing website for Setflo (iOS app).
Tagline: “Do one thing well.”
Guiding line: “One focus. No distractions.”
Category: Health & Fitness (secondary: Productivity)
Tone: calm-minimal but punchy; no “hustle” vibe.

================================================================================
TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Fully responsive
- Deploy-ready
- No database
- Email capture (“Get updates”) using a POST endpoint that stores emails to a local JSON file in the repo (e.g. /data/waitlist.json). If file write fails (serverless), fall back to in-memory and log a clear warning. Add TODO to wire to ConvertKit/Mailchimp later.
- SEO basics: meta title/description, Open Graph tags, Twitter card, favicon placeholder
- Analytics placeholder (commented): Plausible or GA
- Ensure npm run build passes with zero TypeScript errors

================================================================================
ROUTES / SITE STRUCTURE
1) /              Home (landing)
2) /support       Support page

DESIGN DIRECTION
- Minimal, “quiet luxury,” generous whitespace
- Bold headline + strong subhead
- One accent color (choose a confident but tasteful accent — e.g. electric blue or sharp lime)
- Subtle lightweight animations (fade/slide) — keep performance high
- Hero includes a phone mock area using placeholder image(s). I’ll replace with real screenshots later.

================================================================================
HOMEPAGE CONTENT (WRITE THE COPY)
Header nav: Setflo | Blog | Support | Privacy | Download
Primary CTA: “Download on iOS” (link placeholder — put a TODO to insert App Store URL)
Secondary CTA: “Get updates” (scroll to email capture)

HERO
- H1: Do one thing well.
- Subhead: One focus. No distractions.
- Body: 2–3 lines: Setflo is a single-focus practice timer that helps you show up daily—without habit clutter, dashboards, or noise.
- Social proof row: “Built for musicians, martial artists, writers, and anyone chasing mastery.”

SECTIONS
1) The problem:
   - “Most habit apps sell you more… Setflo sells you less.”
   - Briefly mention habit clutter, overwhelming dashboards, too many streak mechanics.

2) What Setflo is (feature bullets/cards):
   - Single focus timer
   - Session logging
   - Daily total + lifetime total
   - Milestones & celebrations
   - Trophy cabinet (replay on supported platforms)
   - Export/import backup (user-controlled)

3) How it feels:
   - Calm, minimal, motivating — no streak shame

4) Use cases (cards):
   - Music practice, karate, writing, rehab, language learning

5) FAQ (accordion)
   - Is it a habit tracker?
     “Not really. Setflo is a single-focus practice log—built for mastery, not habit clutter.”
   - Do I need streaks?
     “No. You can show up imperfectly and still make progress.”
   - Is my data private?
     “Yes. Your data stays on-device. Backups are user-initiated exports.”
   - Can I change my focus later?
     “Yes — but Setflo is designed to help you commit to one thing at a time.”

6) Email capture:
   - Title: “Get launch notes + updates”
   - One email field + submit
   - Success state + toast: “You’re on the list.”
   - Add simple spam prevention: honeypot field (hidden)

FOOTER

================================================================================
SUPPORT PAGE (/support)
Include:
- Intro + “We typically reply within 2–3 business days.” (don’t promise faster)
- Contact cards:
  - support@setflo.io (primary)
  - hello@setflo.io (general)

- Add a short “Feature requests” section pointing to hello@setflo.io

================================================================================
PRIVACY PAGE (/privacy)
Write a clean privacy policy consistent with “Data not collected” if that’s what App Store privacy states:
- We do not collect, sell, or share personal data.
- Data is stored on-device.
- Export files are user-initiated and saved where the user chooses.
- No ads, no third-party trackers by default.
- If analytics is enabled later, update policy.
- Contact for privacy: privacy@setflo.io

================================================================================
TERMS PAGE (/terms)
Simple consumer-friendly terms:
- Provided “as is,” no warranties
- Not medical advice
- User responsible for backups
- Contact: legal@setflo.io

================================================================================
BLOG (MDX)
Implement MDX support and ship with 3 starter posts:
1) “One focus beats ten habits”
2) “Practice snacks: why small sessions compound”
3) “Greasing the groove (without the hype)”
Make them short but genuinely useful and on-brand.

================================================================================
PRESS KIT (/press)
- One-paragraph description of Setflo
- Feature bullets
- Screenshots grid (placeholders)
- Brand assets placeholders (logo svg/png to be added)

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Reusable components:
  Header, Footer, CTAButton, Section, PhoneMock, FAQAccordion, Toast
- Consistent max width + spacing system
- Form validation (email format), friendly error messages
- Waitlist API:
  - POST /api/waitlist
  - Store timestamp + email
  - Prevent duplicates
  - Rate-limit lightly (basic in-memory per-IP throttle is fine)
- README includes:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
  - npm run build
  - How to deploy
  - Where to set the App Store URL, replace email addresses, add screenshots

Build it now.
